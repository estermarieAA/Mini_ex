**Mini exercise 3**
For this week's exercise of designing a throbber I wanted to take a different approach than the usual way that a throbber works.  I like the idea that is presented in the texts for this week, emphazising the quality of 'waiting-time'. I thought it would be interesting to sort of shift perspectives from the throbber being something you dread because it implies that the thing (page, video, file and so on) you want to access is not immediately available; to a throbber being something you could enjoy and play around with. Everything regarding computers and software is moving so much faster than just a couple of years ago, and I think this fast moving pace is also something that reflects in our surrounding society in this digital age. When I encounter a throbber - either when watching a tv-show on Netflix or trying to load a webpage when my wiFi isn't working - it leads to frustration and in a sense a feeling of loosing control because I have no power over these loading icons. For me it would be interesting to see what would happen if you changed the perspective, so this idea of creating a throbber that would provide a needed break and enjoyment instead of frustration is what laid the groundwork for my program. 

The throbber I designed is supposed to give back to you the sense of power or control that is usually lost when encounting a webpage or file that takes forever to load. It consists of four green circles that are filled with another tone of green as you move the mouse around the page. Beneath the circles it says "fill circles to access page" - obviously I haven't designed a page to access, so when you fill the circles, nothing really happens. The syntax that I used is inspired from Daniel Shiffmans video where he creates a clock, because I remembered him making a circle that would fill up in the process of eventually creating a clock; however, it was difficult for me because I wanted to map it in way where the arc or the bar inside the circle would fill  up following the x and y-coordinates of the mouse, and I really couldn't work out how it would be able to do that. As a result, it seems like it sort of randomly fills up the circles when you move the mouse around the page. This was not the intention, but I think it still gets the message across of the interesting issue of how you would react to a throbber where you would have the power and thereby a different space is created than the usual one characterized by frustration and impatience.
