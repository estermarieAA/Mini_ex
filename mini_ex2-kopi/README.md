**Mini exercise 2**
For this weeks mini exercise I have created a program that consists of an orange button and a drawing of some french fries. The orange button says "click for fun", but when you click it, nothing happens except some text popping up - it's in danish and can be translated to something like "gotcha". When you click ENTER, the text disappears.
I actually started with the idea of having a button that would make something happen when you clicked it. I explored different shapes and colors and was very interested with the possible function of making the button change color when you would click it or hover over it - in a way that would signalize kind of, this is not just a random circle, this is a button you can click on. For me that was really fun, experimenting with the looks of it and how I could make it visually “pop out” with shadows and so on. However, it was difficult for me to find the right function to use from the p5.js reference list. 
I was very aware of trying to do as much of the coding as possible from the syntaxes I already remembered, resulting in the fact that the program itself is very simple. For me it was important to simply understand the what kind of shapes I was able to draw without searching in the p5.js reference list. 
I had some difficulties with the mouse-press/mouse-click function, as I only wanted for the button to change color if you actually clicked inside the ellipse and not just anywhere on the site; it took me a long time to understand how this worked, but eventually I got the hang of it. 

The function of this program is extremely simple and also does not address the notion of fun in a sort of "ha-ha something hilarious just happened"-sort of way; it's more just lame and sort of geeky, which is, for me, also a way that you can address this subject. In regard to Goriunova's notion of fun it sort of tags along with this thought that programming should not necessarily be rational, progressive, or even purposeful. There's also an aspect of exploration and playfulness to creating a program without any purpose - in my case at least.  You could say that this explorative approach was fun for me in a way that I didn’t have a goal, so instead I had the opportunity to play with everything creatively.
