The making of this program was my very first coding experience. Initially, I had an idea that I was going to create something really awesome and advanced - however, this idea changed as I ran into a problem already before the actual coding process. I accidentally did not save my mini_ex1 project in the p5 folder, and as a result, I wasn't able to see my project in a browser when opening the atom-live-server. The instructor, Ann, explained to me that the issue was that the program had no access to the library from the p5 folder, and we fixed this together. 

When I had finally gotten the server to show something, I started playing around with different colors of the background and sizes of different shapes. I then explored some of the different syntaxes for 3D shapes, and experimented with changing the variables of, for instance, a torus, to see what result the different numbers produced. I ended up with quite a different variation of the torus than what i started with - this is the black 'star'-thing that rotates in the middle of the green sphere. I spend a lot of time creating new 3D shapes and changing their variables and their stroke- and fill-colors. Thus, a lot of my coding for this project revolved around taking examples from the p5.js reference list and changing them into something that would fit under my aesthetic. 

The project that I ended up creating, as you see in the example-screenshot, was quite a simple one and also does not have any interactive feature to it. However, as a first coding project this was challenging enough for me; in creating more complex variables for shapes I often saw myself getting very frustrated and impatient and realized that the best thing for me would be to take baby-steps in the beginning. I imagine that I will need to, firstly, build a groundwork of understanding the basic and simple stuff - then later on, I will be able to create something more advanced. 

I must admit that my biggest challenge is definitely being patient; the field of coding - or you may even say, the language of coding - is brand new to me, and I am very aware that I can't even begin to grasp how much stuff there is to learn within this field. Partly, the frustrating thing for me is that i did not have any knowledge regarding coding prior to this course, and in a way it definitely feels like there's this whole new language that I can't yet seem to understand. Somehow, I also see myself get affected by those of my classmates who already now some coding and obviously are ahead of me, and this leads to some sort of impatience. I guess you can compare this to if you were a group of people who had to learn a new language, and a third of them would already now the basics. 

Anyway, I imagine that as we go along and I start to learn the basics of coding at my own pace, this impatience that I feel at the moment will decrease. Also, I'm looking forward to using this language of coding creativily, as a way of expressing my ideas in an aesthetic that I am just about to be acquinted with. Despite of eventual frustration, my enthusiasm is definitely not affected, because I am starting to realize how creative and explorative you can be with code.
