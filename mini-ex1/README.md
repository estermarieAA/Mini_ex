The making of this program was my very first coding experience. Initially, I had an idea that I was going to create something really awesome and advanced - however, this idea changed as I ran into a problem already before the actual coding process. I accidentally did not save my mini_ex1 project in the p5 folder, and as a result, I wasn't able to see my project in a browser when opening the atom-live-server. The instructor, Ann, explained to me that the issue was that the program had no access to the library from the p5 folder, and we fixed this together. 
When I had finally gotten the server to show something, I started playing around with different colors of the background and sizes of different shapes. I then explored some of the different syntaxes for 3D shapes, and experimented with changing the variables of, for instance, a torus, to see what result the different numbers produced. I ended up with quite a different variation of the torus than what i started with - this is the black 'star'-thing that rotates in the middle of the green sphere. I spend a lot of time creating new 3D shapes and changing their variables and their stroke- and fill-colors. Thus, a lot of my coding for this project revolved around taking examples from the p5.js reference list and changing them into something that would fit under my aesthetic. 
The project that I ended up creating, as you see in the example-screenshot, was quite a simple one and also does not have any interactive feature to it. However, as a first coding project this was challenging enough for me; in creating more complex variables for shapes I often saw myself getting very frustrated and impatient and realized that the best thing for me would be to take baby-steps in the beginning. I imagine that I will need to, firstly, build a groundwork of understanding the basic and simple stuff - then later on, I will be able to create something more advanced.
