**Mini exercise 5**
The main thing that my program for this weeks mini exercise consists of is a class of stars that are constructed (with a random radius that lies between the numbers 0,2-2 and 0,2-1) every time you click the mouse. The class is called bubbles in my source code because it draws inspiration from Daniel Shiffmans video "7.3: Arrays of Objects - p5.js Tutorial‚Äù, where he creates this moving ellipse object that will show whenever you click the move (or, in the end of the video, when you drag the mouse across the page). I used most of his source code and then simply put in a star function instead of an ellipse - and changed some of the variables. Other than that, the code consists of a function that draws a gradient background and some text.

My idea was that, if I wanted to work more on this program and make it into a game, there would be some sort of goal where you had to complete a constellation by drawing stars in the correct spots. I also thought that I might have either a couple of links or some example images of well-known constellations in the left side of the page.
