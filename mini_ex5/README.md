**Mini exercise 5**

The main thing that my program for this weeks mini exercise consists of is a class of stars that are constructed (with a random radius that lies between the numbers 0,2-2 and 0,2-1) every time you click the mouse. The star-objects have two attributes that can vary, one is the radius of the middle of the star (without the triangle shapes) and the other one is the radius of the entire star. In this way, the randomly constructed stars look quite different from eachother in size and shape. The class that I've used is called bubbles in my source code because it draws inspiration from Daniel Shiffmans video "7.3: Arrays of Objects - p5.js Tutorial‚Äù, where he creates this moving ellipse object that will show whenever you click the move (or, in the end of the video, when you drag the mouse across the page). I used most of his source code and then simply put in a star function instead of an ellipse - and changed some of the variables. Other than that, the code consists of a function that draws a gradient background and some text.

My idea was that, if I wanted to work more on this program and make it into a game, there would be some sort of goal where you had to complete a constellation by drawing stars in the correct spots. I also thought that I might have either a couple of links or some example images of well-known constellations in the left side of the page. 

Object oriented programming can be very helpful and a valuable trick when you want to have a program with multiple objects that have different parameters (such as size, color, placement, speed and so on). Objects and classes can also make it possible to organize your code in a way that will make it easier to manage. 

The good thing about making object-oriented programming is that it makes it easy to make multiple objects fast and make them differ in some parameters such as color, size, placement, speed and so on. Also, the code is more organized and easier to manage because you can work with the class-based objects without making changes in the actual class. 

Looking at my program in a cultural context I think the interesting thing about it would be that it approaches the term "game" very differently from what I would immediately connect with it. My personal preference when it comes to online games is and always has been something that provides the possibility to be creative - instead of the "you have to complete these tasks to win" or "you compete against these other players" kind of games. I think that the tendency within the games or platforms where the foundation of them regards creativity of some sort is that there's often an integrated idea that the created content is also meant to be shared. If you think about a social media platform like Instagram I think you can see this tendency in how it has evolved through the past couple of years; the focus has shifted from playing creatively with pictures and filters for your own enjoyment to this endless sharing of content in the attempt of getting more likes and followers - in other words, you're only being creative for others to see it. Obvouisly this is a generalizing thought and it might not be true for everyone, but for me at least, I think we need to have more creativity in games that doe not have sharing as the main objective.
