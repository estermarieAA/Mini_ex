**Mini exercise 4**
The central parts of my mini exercise this week are the select-button and the regular button from the p5.dom library reference.  Other than these buttons, the program simply consists of some text and a box that pops up if you click the 'gain access!' button. The functions of this program is therefore really simple, and it is more a sort of static statement that should make you think twice than it is an interactive program. I tried to draw inspiration from something that you, as a user of the web, have encountered many many times - either in the shape of input boxes or select buttons, these fields that recquire your personal information are everywhere around the web; when you buy something online, when you create an account on a new platform, when you subscribe to a customizable news feed etc. 

What I particularly picked up on from the texts of this week regards the issue of this enormous amount of information about ourselves that we reveal by using the web. Our every move is not only tracked, it is also stored and made available for large companies and coorporations who uses this for purposes that are based on todays capitalist ideology. To me, the thought of how much of my personal information that is accessible as a result of my use of the internet is very frightening. However, I feel as if I have no power over this data capturing; if I really didn't want this to happen, the only choice for me would be to completely boykott the sites that connect me with my friends, that give me information or inspiration and so on. And I don't want to do that, because these are a big part of my everyday life - so what is there really for me to do? The open call "CAPTURE ALL" from Transmediale questions this excact dilemma: "Are there still modes of being that resist the imperative of digital capitalism to CAPTURE ALL or is there no option but to play along?". 

Now, what I thought would be interesting was to combine the, you might say, visible information that you give away which would for instance be your name, age and gender when creating an account on a social networking platform. You obviously know that this information about you is out there, it is saved and stored. However, the websites and platforms that we use today are able to store so much more information than we'd actually like. I wanted to pinpoint this by not only asking for standard information in my program, but also questioning more personal things like your favourite music genre and the amount of money in your savings account. 

The code that I've created is quite long especially because I wanted there to be many options for the individual select-buttons - I thought that there might be an easier way to do this by maybe creating some variables. Also, I had some difficulties with making anything happen when you would click the last button, so in the end i decided to make an (invisible) ellipse button on top of the button that would make an error-sign appear.
